### Algoexpert

The only reason why I chose the Algoexpert ad is because I literally saw it about a thousand times the past 6 months or so. Anyway, at the start of the ad, the girl asks an intriguing question: “Do you know what the scariest thing in the world is?” The background music and sound effects at that scene complements but doesn’t overwhelm the main voice over… giving it a scary part of a cartoon horror movie type of vibe. Since this is an ad promoting an online platform as a product or a SAAS-like product, I wouldn’t expect any other objects outside of the main product, Algoexpert. The setting where the ad was shot was probably an office or home because there’s no real need to go to Mount Everest to shoot an ad about coding interviews.... Actually, to generalize everything, most symbolic codes don’t really apply in an ad similar to Algoexpert… well, maybe except for body language. In this video, it’s mostly facial expressions… so facial language? The facial expressions were just right, not too exaggerated but not too dull. Aside from, good lighting and an eye level shot angle… there’s nothing much to say about the technical codes of this ad. At the end of the ad, the brand name of Algoexpert was “typed” in for one last reminder that the platform is algoexpert.io.

The Algoexpert ad doesn’t have a deeper meaning or message… other than “Algoexpert is the best platform for preparing for coding interviews”. First of all, not knowing how to invert a binary tree during a coding interview is not the scariest thing in the world (although it has been some sort of a meme in the tech community)… not knowing how to use React Hooks in a frontend interview is. But in all seriousness, I like the fact that the ad was straight to the point (I don’t like the ones that drag out for 2-5 minutes, unless if it’s an educational or informative ad or something similar) and was able to promote almost every feature of their platform within 35 seconds whilst not being a gigantic and overwhelming info dump. I think the first part of the ad was a good setup so people who saw the ad for the first time, get intrigued and will watch a little longer(I did… and was later disappointed that it was “not knowing how to invert a binary tree”). Overall, I’ll give this ad a rating of, 3.5 / 5.

### Lazada ad

I think I’m traumatized from seeing this ad too many times. The first part of the ad, unlike Algoexpert’s ad, does not ask a question, but it brings up the main “purpose” of the ad immediately: promoting of Lazada’s 11-11 sale. I just like to highlight the start where there’s a “notification” animation on the video, so that animation won’t go unnoticed(…well, most of the time). I like the fact the girl didn’t repeat what the guy said, and their voice were clear. The “song” was a good idea to blend both background music and words spoken by a human being… together (it also helped when the song starts playing around the 4 second mark). The setting was (what I’m assuming) probably “green-screened” to make their background a (what I’m assuming) 3d modelling of a room. The colors of the rooms are blue and pink on the left and right probably because blue is often a color that’s more associated with male than female and pink is more associated with female than male (which purpose is probably to appeal to both audiences, male and female). And to further emphasize the point stated in parentheses, the objects used to showcase “items” can be interpreted as “gender-specific”. The costumes the actor and actress wore were to just promote some of the products found on the platform. The body language of these characters obviously implies that they’re happy, excited, thrilled, or any other positive feeling… which gives the viewers of the ad an idea that this is a very festive and wonderful occasion! I would also like to point out the part where the “click” and a bunch of boxes show up… which probably means that the ad also promotes how fast, instantaneous, and easy it is to order on Lazada. The centered text during some parts of the ad were helpful for people who don’t know what they’re doing on their phone (“adding to cart”)... and to keep emphasizing that the price are “super” low.

This ad, like Algoexpert’s ad, has no deeper meaning or message and is just there to promote their product. I honestly don’t like this ad, but it’s mostly because I don’t like (or don’t understand) the idea of buying “a lot” of products or things that aren’t even a necessity… Seriously, the guy and the girl changed outfits every couple of seconds, and look at the video at 0:21… the boxes appear left and right… is this how other people spend money? I doubt people spend money that often or that carelessly… I hope. Aside from that, this ad was well done, although production of this ad might have been expensive. With all my biases aside, I’d rate this a 4 / 5 (with my bias, I’d rate this 1 / 5).
