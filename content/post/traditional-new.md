## Traditional vs New Media: What and Why?

Where to begin… I know! Let's start by enumerating what traditional and new media generally is. Now I am given to understand that traditional media is the media that isn't too old (making transfer of information from one person to others rather inconvenient), but before the rise of the internet and the web. Traditional media (the name) is kind of misleading. Of course, traditional is relative (and it's obvious as to what it's relative to) and should be given a more descriptive name. Anyway, traditional media, relative to today's media, is a better form of media compared to its predecessor (predecessor here means whatever form of media came before it). It allows the opportunity of spreading of information from one source (e.g. radio, news broadcaster, newspaper) to multiple other people in the world. It's not really instantaneous (compared to new media), but it's pretty good and served its purpose. New media, on the other hand, is also better than its predecessor. Spreading of information from one source to another is more "instantaneous", but wait… is that it? Well, no. The rise of the internet paved the way to freedom of speech or opinion or… anything in a sense. "New" media essentially shot up the quality of the education of the entire world, and there are more positives that have come about. Unfortunately, there are some negatives like scammers and spreaders of fake news. Now, the real question is eventually… what is the next form of media. I have no doubt that there will be a new form of media on the rise ( maybe in the next century or so… ), and the "Age of the Internet" will be labeled as "Traditional Media", and the other the "New Media". Why do I think that there will be another "rise"? Isn't the internet the best form of media that humans could possibly hope for? Let's do a thought experiment, if you were a man / woman from the year 69 B.C. would you have thought that the media or mode of communication (or transfer of information from one person to another) would've progressed as far as to news broadcasters on radio or tv? Probably, not. Imagine being in 2020 (which I hope you are in 2020), all you see is a form of media that surpasses that of "traditional media" and most people just… don't give much thought or enough appreciation. There are some more improvements to make from the current form of media. Maybe innovators and scientists will figure out a way to invent a new form of media that is retains all the positives of the current media and erases any form of malicious / hurtful content. Or maybe, we can somehow make it more "instantaneous". Eventually, we will get a new form of media… or we get a slightly modified version of current media (a version 1.0.1 if you will)... or we can get an add-on to the existing media (a version 1.1.0 if you will). Either that… or there might be events (that may be positive) that causes a "disconnect" from one group of people to the other group of people and would require a new form of media (or a modified version). And I hope we can get to live till the day we can tell our grandkids: "Back in my day… we didn't have x or y or z or… wow, you kids do have a lot… we don't usually go beyond z".
